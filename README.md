# rental-yield-maximizer

### Introduction
This project aims to identify how landlords can maximize the rental yield from their properties. We will be using [Rightmove](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/) data to explore how different descriptions and pictures affect the rental yield of a property. Ideally this tool will allow landlords to capture/select the ideal photos that will maximize the rental yield for their property (or alternatively the ideally phrased description for their specific property).
